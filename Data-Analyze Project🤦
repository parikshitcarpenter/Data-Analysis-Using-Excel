# Data-Analysis-Using-Excel

As a skilled data analyst, I utilized the powerful features of Microsoft Excel to perform in-depth data analysis and generate valuable insights. I effectively worked with large datasets, performing data cleaning and data validation techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability of the data.

One of the key tools I employed was Pivot Tables, which allowed me to summarize and analyze data in a dynamic and interactive way. I created Pivot Tables to aggregate and analyze data based on various criteria such as province, sales rap, and product. I also utilized Pivot Charts to visually represent the data in the form of bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, providing meaningful and easy-to-understand visualizations.

To enhance the functionality and user-friendliness of the data analysis, I added slicers and filters to the Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. This allowed the managerial team to easily filter and slice the data based on their requirements, enabling them to make informed decisions.

I also created a comprehensive dashboard that combined all the key insights and visualizations in a single Excel sheet. The dashboard provided an interactive interface for the managerial team to quickly access and analyze the data. It included dynamic Pivot Charts with slicers and filters, allowing the team to explore the data in a flexible and interactive manner.

In addition, I conducted a thorough analysis of the data to identify the highest selling province, lowest selling province, sales rap with the highest and lowest turnover, and the products with the highest and lowest turnover. Based on the analysis, I also recommended appropriate actions, such as setting prices with a 25% off discount for the lowest turnover products to increase sales.

Furthermore, I identified the month of January as the month that mostly needed promotion activities, based on the data analysis. I also determined the top revenue generating sales rap and the province they belonged to, in order to recommend them for the "Best Province & Sales Rap of the Quarter" award.

Overall, my expertise in data analytics using Excel, including working with Pivot Tables, creating interactive dashboards, utilizing slicers and filters, and conducting comprehensive data analysis, enabled me to provide valuable insights and recommendations to the managerial team for informed decision-making.
